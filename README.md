# FullStack Makeshift Web Shop

This is my webshop App where I demonstrate my skills in creating a functional website
using **Typescript** with many libraries required.

### Description of Structure

* The app uses mongoDB for storing userdata 
    and the many products that i "sell" in the website

* The app uses token authentication using the jsonwebtoken 
    library to sign and verify the user token for various actions.

* The user password is encypted and the hash is stored in the backend

* The Frontend and the Backend communicate via API.

### Libraries used

* Express, React, Jsonwebtoken, Mongoose, React-Router-Dom, FontAwsome, Flaticon, Cypress...  

I won't be listing all.
